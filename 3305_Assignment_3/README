Purpose of the assignment are the following:

  • Gain more experience with the C programming language from an OS’s process/thread.
  
  • Get hands-on experience with the process/thread related function calls.
  
 Process vs Thread:
 
 The program will test the data sharing ability of a thread and process. The program will do the following:
 
  1. The parent program will have three variables: int x,y,z; which to be initialized as 10, 20, and 0, respectively.
  
  2. parent creating child: parent will create a child by fork() and the child will perform
     z = x+y (i.e., add x and y and store the results in z). parent will wait for child to complete before parent proceeds.
     Upon completion of child, parent will print out the value of z. 

  3. parent creating thread: After (2) above is completed, parent process will now create a thread by pthread_create() 
     which will do the exact same task done by child above (i.e., z = x+y). 
     parent will wait for its thread to complete before parent proceeds. 
     Upon completion of the thread, parent will print out the value of z.
