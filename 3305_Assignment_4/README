Purpose and goals of this assignment:

  • Gain more experience with the C programming language from an OS’s CPU scheduling perspective.
  
  • Get hands-on experience with the CPU scheduling algorithms.
  
  
-- Performance Evaluation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms --

 In this program I apply CPU Scheduling Algorithms in the C programming language. 
 A sample input file is provided with skeleton code, which is used to develop the CPU Scheduling Algorithm, Round Robin (RR).
 
  Skeleton Code:
  
  The provided skeleton code performs the following:
  
    1. Creates the number of ready queues as stated in the input file and assigns a time quantum for each queue.
    
    2. Creates all the processes for each of the ready queues based on the input file specifications (such as CPU burst time, arrival order, etc.).
    
    3. Once the simulation of all the ready queues is complete, the program will output results to a text file “cpu_scheduling_output_file.txt”.
    
  What has been done:

      The CPU scheduling algorithm RR was applied on each ready queue. 
      
      Ready queues are simulated in the order of their queue number (q 1, q 2, etc.).
      
      The “rr” function in the file scheduling.c was implemented. (See comments in the scheduling.c file to see what the function does).
      
      Helper functions in the scheduling.c file were also created in order to meet the project requirements.
