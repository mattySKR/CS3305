The goals of this assignment are the following:

  • Get experience with the fork(), wait() and pipe() system functions
  
  • Learn more about how operating systems are structured
  
  • Practice C programming language from an OS perspective
  
  
 Inter-Process Communications / The programm does the following:
 
    The program that will accept three strings from the user as command line arguments (for
    example, X, Y and Z).
 
    The program will create a parent and child where the parent process will
    read X and the child process will read Y and Z. 
 
    The child process will concatenate Y and Z to generate Y’. 
 
    child process will send Y’ to parent process by communicating through a pipe (i.e.,
    shared memory). 

    Then, the parent process will concatenate X and Y’ and output the resulting string.
  
    The expected output from your program will look like the following for the arguments “CS”
    “3305” and “ is fun!”:
