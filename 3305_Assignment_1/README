The goals of this assignment are the following:

  • Practice with the fork(), wait() and execl() system functions
  
  • Learn how operating systems are structured
  
  • Practice C programming language from an OS perspective

  
The program performs the following tasks:
  
  1. Program will create a parent process which will create two child processes (e.g., child_1, and child_2)
  
  2. parent will wait for child_1 to complete before creating child_2
  
  3. child_1 will create its own child child_1.1
  
  4. Inside child_2, a system call to an external program will be made. child_2 will pass its PID to the external
     program “external_program.out.” As a result of this external program call, child_2 will be replaced by
     external_program.out (hint: execl()). The path to the external program “external_program.out” will be passed
     into the program as a command line argument.
